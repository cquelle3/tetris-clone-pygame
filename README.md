# Tetris Pygame
A clone of Tetris using Python and Pygame.

# Install
**Please make sure to have Python installed. I used Python 3.11 for this project.**

Install Pygame. I used Pygame Community Edition, but original Pygame should work as well.
```
pip install pygame-ce
```
or
```
pip install pygame
```

# Run
Run the game using
```
python game.py
```

Have fun!
